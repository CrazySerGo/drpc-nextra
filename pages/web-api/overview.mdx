# Overview

In the DRPC Dashboard you can see the statistics of the user on the [`Stats`](https://drpc.org/dashboard/statistics) page. There are charts and tables with the information about the user's activity.
There's also a possibility to get the same information via the API.

To get started you need to generate API token in the DRPC Dashboard. You can do it in the [`Settings` -> `API`](https://drpc.org/dashboard/settings/api) page.
It's also possible to regenerate the token if you need to.

You can get statistics data both by JSON and Prometheus metrics.
For both ways you need to specify `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` token like so:
`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE`

Also both endpoints have rate limit for **10 requests per 1 minute**.

## JSON

The JSON data is available at the `https://drpc.org/api/metrics/json` endpoint.
For JSON endpoint you must specify `range` query parameter to get the data for the specified time range.

Valid values are `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`. So if you want to configure range it will look like `https://drpc.org/api/metrics/json?range=day`.

JSON response has the following format:

```ts copy
type MetricsResponseJSON = {
  balance: number;
  data: GroupedDataItem[];
};

type GroupedDataItem = {
  client_key: string;
  request_count: number;
  cu: number;
  network: string;
  connection: string;
  provider_id: string;
  method: string;
};
```

## Prometheus metrics

The Prometheus metrics are available at the `https://drpc.org/api/metrics/prom` endpoint.
For Prometheus metrics time range is last day.

Prometheus metrics are available in the following format:

```text copy
# HELP drpc_client_balance Balance of DRPC client
# TYPE drpc_client_balance gauge
...
# HELP drpc_client_requests_count Count of DRPC client requests
# TYPE drpc_client_requests_count counter
...
# HELP drpc_client_cu_count Count of DRPC client compute units spent
# TYPE drpc_client_cu_count counter
...
```
