# Rate limiting

We only have rate limiting for requests to public nodes (they are always free of charge).
Because we charge users on per request basis, you can make as much paid requests as you want while you have enough CUs on your deposit.

For requests to free nodes we have following rules

1. There is a limit of 156000 CUs per minute per IP. This is approximately 100 eth_call requests per second
2. Some methods cost 0 CU (like eth_chainId), but when rate limiting the minimum cost of every call is 10 CU, thus free methods could't be abused

We also have public nodes that do not require registration, which have the same rate limiting logic
