# First request to DRPC

First, get your endpoint. If you any questions on how to do it, [look here](./createaccount).

### Authentication

Each enpdoint already contains you authentication key as a URL parameter `dkey`.

However, passing secrets as a GET parameter is not really recommended, unless you have no other way.
Our recommendation is use special HTTP header `Drpc-Key`.

For example:

<Tabs items={['curl', 'HTTP']}>
<Tab>

```bash copy
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Drpc-Key: YOUR-API-KEY' \
-d '{"method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt","params": ["0xd54debfd8aafac846bcf76e01626d4b40d7310b085ded3cc22b5a79e5a20f4ac"],"id": "1","jsonrpc": "2.0"}' \
'YOUR-ENDPOINT-WITHOUT-KEY'
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```http copy
POST YOUR-ENDPOINT-WITHOUT-KEY
content-type: application/json
Drpc-Key: YOUR-API-KEY

{
"method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt",
"params": ["0xd54debfd8aafac846bcf76e01626d4b40d7310b085ded3cc22b5a79e5a20f4ac"],
"id": "1",
"jsonrpc": "2.0"
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Where YOUR-ENDPOINT-WITHOUT-KEY is your endpoint without the dkey parameter, and YOUR-API-KEY is your API key.
The API key is a part of your endpoint by default. Also, you can find it on the settings page of the key you need.

### Making requests

DRPC conforms to standard JSON RPC protocol, that most of the blockchains use today.
So, you can use any standard library for you preferred language to make request, for example:

```js copy
var Web3 = require("web3");
var provider = "YOUR-ENDPOINT";
var web3Provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(provider);
var web3 = new Web3(web3Provider);
web3.eth.getBlockNumber().then((result) => {
  console.log("Latest Ethereum Block is ", result);
});
```

## DRPC SDK

However, there is also DRPC SDK, which supports DRPC protocol, it's an alternative protocol
for calling blockchain methods which allows us to do additional things like response verification,
provider response signatures client check, etc.

Currently, there is only JS version of this library.

1. To install run:

`npm install @drpcorg/drpc-sdk`

2. You can use typescript to customize your endpoint without UI.
   We also support providers for ethere.js and web3.js, for example:

```ts copy
import { DrpcProvider } from "drpc-sdk/dist/esm/providers/ethers";
// for cjs
// import { DrpcProvider } from 'drpc-sdk/dist/cjs/providers/ethers';

async function getBlock(tag) {
  let provider = new DrpcProvider({
    dkey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
    provider_ids: ["public"],
  });
  let block = await provider.getBlock(tag);
}
```

3. You can check the complete docs for our SDK here: [https://p2p-org.github.io/drpc-client/](https://p2p-org.github.io/drpc-client/)
