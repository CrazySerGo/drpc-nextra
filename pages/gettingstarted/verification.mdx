# Verification

As described previously, [DRPC-SDK](https://github.com/p2p-org/drpc-client) allows you to do things like response verification and provider response signatures client check.

On this page we will look at the **response verification** process in more detail.

## Verification process

[DRPC-SDK](https://github.com/p2p-org/drpc-client) client has a params called `quorum_from` and `quorum_of`.

- `quorum_from` is the total amount of responses that you want to receive from the providers.
- `quorum_of` is the amount of **equal responses** that you want to receive from the providers to consider the response as valid.

Since we want `quorum_of` to be more that half of total responses, [DRPC-SDK](https://github.com/p2p-org/drpc-client) will throw an error if `quorum_of` is less than `quorum_from / 2`.

Valid config of quorum params:

```js copy
// Totally fine
const drpc = new HTTPApi({
  ...otherParams,
  quorum_from: 3,
  quorum_of: 2,
});
```

Invalid config of quorum params:

```js
// Will throw an error
const drpc = new HTTPApi({
  ...otherParams,
  quorum_from: 4,
  quorum_of: 2,
});
```
