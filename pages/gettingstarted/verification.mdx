# Verification

As described previously, [DRPC-SDK](https://github.com/p2p-org/drpc-client) allows you to do things like response verification and provider response signatures client check.

On this page we will look at the **response verification** process in more detail.

## API instance config

[DRPC-SDK](https://github.com/p2p-org/drpc-client) client has a params called `quorum_from` and `quorum_of`.

- `quorum_from` is the total amount of responses that you want to receive from the providers.
- `quorum_of` is the amount of **equal responses** that you want to receive from the providers to consider the response as valid.

<Callout>
  Since we want `quorum_of` to be more that half of total responses,
  [DRPC-SDK](https://github.com/p2p-org/drpc-client) will throw an error if
  `quorum_of` is less than `quorum_from / 2`.
</Callout>

Valid config of quorum params:

```js copy
// Totally fine
const drpc = new HTTPApi({
  ...otherParams,
  quorum_from: 3,
  quorum_of: 2,
});
```

Invalid config of quorum params:

```js
// Will throw an error
const drpc = new HTTPApi({
  ...otherParams,
  quorum_from: 4,
  quorum_of: 2,
});
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you only pass one param (`quorum_of` or `quorum_from`), the other one will
  be automatically **set to the same value**. On the other hand, if you pass
  **NO quorum_of and NO quorum_from**, the default value for both of them is
  `1`.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Please also note that `quorum_from`, the total amount of responses for the API
  call should be `less or equal to` the total amount of providers passed to API
  config. Otherwise, API calls will fail.
</Callout>

## Consensus scheme

<Callout type="info">
  DRPC consensus protocol verifies that responses are equal by comparing the
  data. Also it checks the signature of the response by comparing the signature
  of the response with the public key of the provider.
</Callout>

In the example below, we have 3 providers and 2 equal responses to achieve consensus.
